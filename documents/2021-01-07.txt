I started with the revision of the previous two days. It took quite a  time. After that, I analyse history in GitHub repo and try to get back some deleted files in local repo and edit it.

Go through the JavaTpoint git tutorial and  learn new commands as follows:

git branch -- the name of all branches in the current directory
git branch -d  = delete branch
git mergetool= to solve the conflict
git blame = to know more about committer or editor of a particular file 
git commit --ament = add msg to last commit
git commit --no-edit =add a file without creating a new commit
git reflog =show all ref of the local repo
git diff bname@{0} bname@{1.day.ago}= to see diff with  time
git  reset HEAD 1.txt = rest file by one commit
git show - for showing file content diff of the last commit or of given sha

git hash-object -w fname=to get sha of file
git  cat-file -p file_sha = to show files content

study about git hooks


repeat all the command and watch some inner-working videos of git.
